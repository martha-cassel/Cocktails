3 steps to any perfect cocktail or drink from http://www.ginologist.com/ -- decent blog vis a vis information, but heavily spammed with comments from totally unrelated promotional outlets. contractors, make money at home, luis vuitton outlet, etc.

Taste, temperature & presentation.

One thing is to have a nice recipe with all the ingredients that you like - another thing is to be able to make yor drink right, but if you follow these three simple instructions, you are sure to succeed:

1. A drink has to taste well, so don't overdo it. Many peole tend to put in to much alcohol, sugar, tabasco etc. - but don't. Taste always comes first, and if you want effect, you can always have another :o)

2. A drink has to be well tempered, so if it's meant to be served cold, it has to be cold. So shake if you can - stir if you must, and add as much ice as possible. If it's a hot drink, it has to be hot - off course - but without boiling any alcohol off.

3. A drink must look nice and be served in to a suitable glass i.e. straight or mixed spirits in a rocks glass or a shot glass, simple and shaken cocktails in a martini glass, fancy cocktails in a cocktail glass or a wine glass and a build cocktail in a highballer. About garnish: simple is beautifull!

Here are the names of the most used types of glasses:
